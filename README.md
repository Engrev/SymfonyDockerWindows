# Symfony project in dev environment on Windows 11 with Docker and WSL

## With Docker

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) on your Windows.
- Launch Docker.

### Installation üöß

- Clone this project : `git clone https://github.com/Engrev/SymfonyDockerWindows.git`.
- You can change environment variables in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) as well as the git config in [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile).
- Open a terminal at the root of the project and make `docker compose build`.
- Once the build is complete, make `docker compose up -d`. You should see your image and containers appear in Docker Desktop.

If everything works, you can continue.

### Configuration üîß

You must now create the symfony project.
For this, we need to connect to the php container using the command `docker exec -it <ID_CONTAINER> bash` to run a bash inside the container (**<ID_CONTAINER>** can be recovered thanks to the order `docker ps`).

Once inside, we are in the workspace **/var/www** (as precised in [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile)).
It is in this directory that we will install our symfony application, with one of the following commands (**app** can be replaced at your convenience) :
1. `symfony new app --webapp` or `composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"7.0.*" app`.
2. `symfony new app --webapp --version=lts` if you want to use an LTS version of Symfony.
   This shortcut is only available with the Symfony binary.
   If you use composer, you must specify the exact version : `composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.4.*" app` for example.

If you use composer, you then need to do `cd app`, `composer require webapp` (you can add the option `--no-interaction` at your commands composer to let him do it, without him asking you any questions).

Now that the symfony project is initialized, you need to configure Apache.
To do this, make `exit` in your terminal to exit the container and return to your windows.
Then run the command `docker cp ./docker/apache.conf <ID_CONTAINER>:/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` so that the apache server can find your site and send it to the browser.

### Use üëç

You now have access to your site at [localhost:8000](http://locahost:8000) and to PHPMyAdmin at [localhost:8080](http://locahost:8080) (as precised in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)).
